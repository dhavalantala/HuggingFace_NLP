    "# **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "As you was in `chapter_1`, Tranformer models are usually very large. With millions to tens of *billions* of parameters, training and deploying these models is a complicated undertaking. Furthermore, with new models being released on a near-daily basis and each having its own implementation, trying them all out is no easy task. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 🤗 Transformers library was created to solve this problem. Its goal is to provide a single API through which any Transformer model can be loaded, trainied, and saved. The library's main features are: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ease of use**: Downloading, loadingm and using a state-of-the-art NLP model for inference can be done in just two lines of code. \n",
    "* **Flexibility**: At their core, all models are simple PyTorch `nn.Module` or TrnsorFlow `tf.keras.Model` classes and can be handled like any other models in their respective machine learning (ML) framworks. \n",
    "* **Simplicity**: Hardly any abstractions are made across the library. The \"All in one file\" is a core concept: a model's forward pass is entirely defined in a single file, so that the code itself is unserstandable and hackable. \n",
    "\n",
    "This last feature makes 🤗 Transformers quite different from other ML libraries. The models are not built on modules that are shared across files; instead, each model has its own layers. In addition to making the models more approachable and understandable, this allows you to easily experiment on one model without affecting others.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will begin with an end-to-end example where we use a model and a tokenizer together to replicate the `pipeline()` function introduced in `Chapter 1`. Next, we’ll discuss the model API: we’ll dive into the model and configuration classes, and show you how to load a model and how it processes numerical inputs to output predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we’ll look at the tokenizer API, which is the other main component of the `pipeline()` function. Tokenizers take care of the first and last processing steps, handling the conversion from text to numerical inputs for the neural network, and the conversion back to text when it is needed. Finally, we’ll show you how to handle sending multiple sentences through a model in a prepared batch, then wrap it all up with a closer look at the high-level `tokenizer()` function."

    "There are also variations of word tokenizers that have extra rules for punctuation. With this kind of tokenizer, we can end up with some pretty large “vocabularies,” where a vocabulary is defined by the total number of independent tokens that we have in our corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each word gets assigned an ID, starting from 0 and going up to the size of the vocabulary. The model uses these IDs to identify each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to completely cover a language with a word-based tokenizer, we’ll need to have an identifier for each word in the language, which will generate a huge amount of tokens. For example, there are over 500,000 words in the English language, so to build a map from each word to an input ID we’d need to keep track of that many IDs. Furthermore, words like “dog” are represented differently from words like “dogs”, and the model will initially have no way of knowing that “dog” and “dogs” are similar: it will identify the two words as unrelated. The same applies to other similar words, like “run” and “running”, which the model will not see as being similar initially.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need a custom token to represent words that are not in our vocabulary. This is known as the “unknown” token, often represented as `”[UNK]”` or `”<unk>”`. It’s generally a bad sign *`if you see that the tokenizer is producing a lot of these tokens, as it wasn’t able to retrieve a sensible representation of a word and you’re losing information along the way`*. The goal when crafting the vocabulary is to do it in such a way that the tokenizer tokenizes as few words as possible into the unknown token.\n",

Since the representation is now based on characters rather than words, one could argue that, intuitively, it’s less meaningful: each character doesn’t mean a lot on its own, whereas that is the case with words. However, this again differs according to the language; in Chinese, for example, each character carries more information than a character in a Latin language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to consider is that we’ll end up with a very large amount of tokens to be processed by our model: whereas a word would only be a single token with a word-based tokenizer, it can easily turn into 10 or more tokens when converted into characters.\n",

    "\n",
    "For instance, “annoyingly” might be considered a rare word and could be decomposed into “annoying” and “ly”. These are both likely to appear more frequently as standalone subwords, while at the same time the meaning of “annoyingly” is kept by the composite meaning of “annoying” and “ly”.\n",

This allows us to have relatively good coverage with small vocabularies, and close to no unknown tokens.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Learned the basic building blocks of a Transformer model.\n",
    "* Learned what makes up a tokenization pipeline.\n",
    "* Saw how to use a Transformer model in practice.\n",
    "* Learned how to leverage a tokenizer to convert text to tensors that are understandable by the model.\n",
    "* Set up a tokenizer and a model together to get from text to predictions.\n",
    "* Learned the limitations of input IDs, and learned about attention masks.\n",
    "* Played around with versatile and configurable tokenizer methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "From now on, you should be able to freely navigate the 🤗 Transformers docs: the vocabulary will sound familiar, and you’ve already seen the methods that you’ll use the majority of the time.\n"
