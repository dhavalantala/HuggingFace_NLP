    "\n",
    "NLP is subfield of AI and computer science that focuses on the interaction between computers and human(natural) languages. The goal of NLP is to enable machines to undstand, interpret, generate, and respond to human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, NLP bridges the gap between human communication and computer understanding, allowing machines to read, hear, and make sense of the vast amounts of human language data. This field combines computational linguistics, machine learning, and deep learning to process, analyze, and generate natural language text or speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of NLP tasks is not only to understand single words individually, but to be able to understand the context of those words.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP isn't limited to written text though. It also tackles complex challenges in speech recognition and computer vision, such as generating a transcript of an audio or a description of an image."

    "Computer don't process information in the same way as humans. For example, When we read the sentence \"I am hungry\", we can easily understand its meaning. Similarly, given two sentences such as \"I am hungry\" and \"I am sad\", we're able to easily determine how similar they are. For machine Learning models, such tasks are more difficult. The text needs to be processed in a way that enables the models to learn from it. And because language is complex, we need to think carefully abbout how this processing must be done. There has been a lot of reasearch done on how to represent text, and we will look at some methods in the next chapter."

    "All the transfomer models mentioned above (GPT, BERT, BART, T5, etc.) have been trained as *language models*. This means they have been trained on large amounts of raw text in a self-supervised fashion. Self-supervised learning is a type of training in which the objective is automatically computed from the inputs of the model. That means that humans are not needed to label the data!\n",

    "This type of model developes a statistical inderstanding of the language it has been trained on, but it's not very useful for specific practical tasks. Because of this, the general pretrained model then goes through a process called ***transfer learning***. During this process, the model is fine-tuned in a supervised way - that is, using human-annotated labels - on a given task. \n",

    "\n",

To perform fine-tuning, you first acquire a pretrained language model; then perform additional trainng training with a dataset specific to your task. Wait - why not simply train the model for your final use case from the start (**scratch**)? There are a couple of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The pretrained model was already trained on a dataset that has some similarities with the fine-tuning dataset. The fine-tuning process is thus able to take knowledge acquired by the initial model during pretraining (for instance, with NLP problems, the pretrained model will have some kind of statistical understanding of the language you are using for your task). \n",
    "* Since the pretrained model was already trained on lots of data, the fine-tuning reqquires way less data to get decent results.\n",
    "* For the same reason, the amount of time and resources needed to get good results are much lower. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one could leverage a pretrained models trained on the English language and then fine-tune it on arXiv corpus, resulting in a science/research-based model.

    "\n",
    "#### **Inroduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is primarily composed of two blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Encoder (left)**: The encoder receives an input and builds a representation of it (its features). This means that the model is optimized to acquire understanding from the input.\n",
    "* **Decoder (right)**: The decoder uses the encoder's representation(features) along with other inputs to generate a traget sequence. This means that the model is optimized for generating outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter1/transformers_blocks.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these parts can be used independently, depending on the task:\n",
    "* **Encoder-only models**: Good for tasks that require understanding of the input, such as sentence classification and named entity recognition. \n",
    "* **Decoder-only models**: Good for generative tasks such as text generation.\n",
    "* **Encoder decoders models** or **sequence-to-sequence models**: Good for generative tasks that require an input, such as translation or summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will dive into those architectures independently in later sections. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Attention Layers**\n",
    "\n",
    "A key features of Transformer models is that they are built with special layers called *attention layers*. In fact, the title of the paper introducing the transformer architecture was \"**Attention Is All you Need**\"! This layer will tell the model to pay specific to certain words in the sentence you passed it (and more or less ignore the others) when dealing with the representation of each word. \n",
    "\n",
    "The same concept applies to any task associated with natural language: a word by itself has meaning, but that meaning is deeply affected by the context, which can be any other word(or words) before or after the word being studied. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have idea of what attention layers are all about, let's take a closer look at the Transformer architecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The Original architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformer architecture was originally for translation. During training, the encoder receives inputs (sentences) in a certain language, while the decoder receive the same sentences in the desired tartget language. In the encoder, the attention layers can use all the words in a sentences (since, as we just saw, the translation of a given word can be dependent on what is after as well as before it in the sentence). The decoder, however, works sequentially and can only pay attention to the words in the sentence that it has already translated (so, only the words before the word currently being generated). For example, when we have predicted the first three words of the translated target, we give them to the decoder which then uses all the inputs of the encoder to try to predict the fourth word.\n",
    "\n",
    "To speed things up during training (when the model has access to target sentences), the encoder is fed the whole target, but it is not allowed to use future words (if it had access to the word at position 2 when trying to predict the word at position 2, the problem would not be very hard!). For instance, when trying to predict the fourth word, the attention layer will only have access to the words in position 1 to 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original Transformer architecture looked like this, with the encoder on the left and the decoder on the right:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter1/transformers.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the first attention layers in a decoder block pays attention to all (past) inputs to the decoder, but the second attention layers uses the output of the encoder. It can thus access the whole input sentence to best predict the current word. This is very useful as different languages can have grammatical rules that put the words in different orders, or some context provided later in the sentence amy be helpful to determine the best translation of a given word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *attention mask* can also be used in the encoder/decoder to prevent the model from paying attention to some special words \n",
    "- for instance, the special padding word used to make all the inputs the same length when batching together sentences. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Architecture vs. checkpoints**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Architecture**: This is the skeleton of the model - the definition of each layers and each operation that happens within the model.\n",
    "* **Checkpoints**: These are the weight that will be loaded in a given architecture.\n",
    "* **Model**: This is umbralla term that isn't as precise as \"architecture\" or \"checkpoint\" : it can mean both. This course will specify *architecture* or *checkpoint* when it matters to reduce ambiguity. "
